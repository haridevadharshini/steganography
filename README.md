üîê Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

 It is a project that focuses on embedding secret information within digital images to ensure secure communication. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography hides data in plain sight, making it difficult to detect. This project explores different techniques like Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution to embed data efficiently while maintaining image quality. By incorporating encryption and key-based embedding, this project enhances security and prevents unauthorized access. It has applications in secure messaging, digital watermarking, and cybersecurity.
